# Introduction
This course guides Java developers step by step to write their first simple test to developing robust test sets that are maintainable, readable and trustworthy.

Participants will master simple unit testing ideas and then move to higher value topics like mocks, stubs and 
isolation including frameworks such as Test Double and Injection Mechanisms.

In this course writing testable code concepts are explained in different units followed by corresponding exercises.
In the exercises the developer/participants will practice the concepts that have been taught in the unit.

# Unit Testing in Java
Unit testing is when a programmer write test code to verify units of code.
When your programming in Java ,you write unit tests in Java.These unit tests are run through JUnit,a testing framework that marks the tests as passing or failing.

In introduction to JUnit unit you will learn and practice how to set up a your java project and how to add test class, and you'll see what a test method looks like.Most important, you will learn how to get JUnit to run your new,passing test.

# Test Driven Development
Test Driven Development (TDD) is iterative process in which test cases are written before a soluton is implemented.
It relies on the repetition of very short development cycle first the developer writes an intially failing automated test case that defines a desired improvement or a new funtion, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

In introduction to TDD you will learn and practice TDD principles on a Java Exercise.

# Test Isolation
In Test Isolation unit you would understand how to isolate the dependent component from the code under test.
This unit will show you how you can find seams/layers that can be separated from the code under test.
It will prepare the code under test for testability and then shows how the dependent component can be injected via different injection mechanism.

# Clean Code
This unit cover the best practices that you as a Java programmer needs to consider when writing any new feature in your code base.
