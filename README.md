# Exercise: Test-Driven Development (Java)

- Implement in Pair Programming
- Switch roles after each TDD cycle

### Scenario: Implement a Fizz Buzz game
Write a function that returns true or false depending on 
whether its input integer is a leap year or not.

A leap year is defined as 
- one that is divisible by 4
- but it is not divisible by 100
- unless it is also divisible by 400.

For example, \
2001 is a typical common year and 1996 is a typical leap year, \
whereas 1900 is an atypical common year and 2000 is an atypical leap year.
